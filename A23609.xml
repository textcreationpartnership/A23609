            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And ſurely if the Lord give an underſtanding heart, and enlightened eyes in the reading hereof, it will be a means to take off that prejudice which generally reſts in the minds of many. We finde that moſt perſons in theſe dayes are ſubject to one of theſe three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams <hi>viz.</hi> To ſit down in a ſtate of wickednes, without God in the world, or elſe to clothe themſelvs with a form of godlinesſe, without the power of it: and ſo walk ſhort of the golden rule of the Goſpel in contenting themſelvs in a Babyloniſh ſtate, or become national under pretended enjoyments, trampling the Lord and his truth under-foot, as legall, and too contemptible for them to walk in: but if any hereby ſhall gain information and a heart made willing to follow the Lamb whitherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he goeth, God ſhall have the glory, themſelves ſhall reap the benefit, and we ſhall receive our reward, who ſubſcribe ourſelves faithfull friends to all that wiſh well to Sion.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:36995:4"/> ſtrive to honor God, by a stedfaſt continuance in what we have received, and in diligent ſpeaking the things which we have ſeen and heard from him; the weight of which at firſt prevailed upon us to declare unto the World this our <hi>Confeſſion of Faith, and faithful Epiſtle,</hi> which we have again reprinted, and made publick, for the Reaſons following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The invitations and earneſt ſolicitations of ſeveral of our Brethren, from all parts of the Nation, whoſe hearts long to behold (in publick) our ſtability and perſeverance in the way and truth of our God, that by it they may have where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with, to put to ſilence thoſe who have lately taken liberty to reproach and undervalue the Truth profeſſed by us.</p>

The Lord himſelf proclaims from Heaven, that his ways are righteous, and the juſt ſhal walk in them, but tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors ſhall fall therein, <hi>Hoſ. 14. ult.</hi> The narrow path of the Saints righteous walk, ſuits not with the licentious principles and intereſts of carnall men; and though ſinners may be in Sion for a time, yet fear ſurpriſes them, and by reaſon of the purity and brightnes of the ways of God, they cannot abide therein, but caſt Chriſts yoke from their necks, becauſe it will not be ſubſervient to their own luſts. A remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able example of Gods ſeverity againſt thoſe that ſometimes profeſſed the truth, whoſe hearts were not right before God, we may ſee in <hi>Judas,</hi> and in <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> who for lying againſt the Holy Ghoſt, were ſuddenly deſtroyed, to the great fear of all the Church of Chriſt. As in Nature, the corruption of the beſt things is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt corruption, ſo the greater profeſſion men make of the truth, when once they be corrupted, they fall into the groſſeſt abominations. The truth is, this is no ground to ſuſpect our profeſſion, becauſe ſome fall from it: for who is it that ſins the unpardonable ſin, but one that profeſſed the truth of the Goſpel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 5, 6. Who are thoſe that are twice dead, plucked up by the roots? except thoſe that by profeſſion were formerly alive in the truth.</p>

            <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, We do acknowledg, though ſome eminent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the ſame truth with us have faln foully (which hath been the occaſion of much grief to us) yet it hath been hitherto, and we hope ever ſhall be our care (as they have been by the righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God diſcovered) according to our duty to put them from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, endeavouring to preſerve our ſelves from all iniquity, and not to have fellowſhip with the unprofitable works of darkneſs, but rather to reprove them.

            <p>While ſome men cry out againſt us for uncharitableneſs, in crying down ſin and ſinfull practices, O how uncharitable in truth are they, that can ſuffer GOD to be diſhonoured, his Son to be vilified, his Truth trampled under foot, his Ordinances fleighted, and their own and thouſands of poor ſouls in danger of being utterly ſeduced, to their own deſtruction, and yet have not a heart to relent for ſuch practices, nor a tongue to plead againſt them, whereby others might be fore warned of their ſwift approaching danger; our conſciences bear witnes, that the honor of God, the love of his Truth, zeal for his Name, and if poſſible, the ſaving of ſouls from death, hath been the prevailing argument with us, thus to expreſſe our ſelves; beſeeching the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus, that by the ſame power which raiſed him from the dead, he would make this inſtrumentall to confirm thoſe who yet abide in the Truth, to reſtore all the ſimple in heart, who are ready to turn aſide from the voice of the true Shepherd, and to follow ſtrangers, and the cunning ſleights and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
